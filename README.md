# Litesy
Light and easy GObject development framework

Sometime, when we want to create an app with a programming language, we’ll faced to compilation (except for script languages) and distributing steps, we want to make this much easier to fostering our development, especially when we want to distribute to other OS or distros.
Therefore, we need a development framework that make cross compiling and distribution are easy. :smile:

* Just as its name, it’s lightweight and easy.
* Cross platform, exactly.
* Multi programming language support.
* Has comprehensive libraries.
* Made with love and sincerity :-)

Packages:
* SDK: Build tools, packager, emulator, debugger, profiler.
* Runtime: Package manager (install and update components made easy), remote testing (a client app of Build tools that provides a screen with VNC), etc.

Anyways, let's do our best!
